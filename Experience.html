  <p>My first job as a developer was a very interesting experience.  I was working for a newer
  company called MC Integration Solutions.  Working there part-time while in school was a nice
  transition into the developer work force.  I learned a lot about how different medical providers
  share data, and some gaps that currently exist in the system.  Coding solutions for these gaps
  provided a creative atmosphere utilizing several skills including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  I enjoyed working at MC, but wanted experience working with a larger organization which
  brought me to WPS Health Solutions.
  </p>

  <p>As a .NET Software Developer Intern WPS Health Solutions I am getting the experience that
  I need to be a successful back-end developer.  I am working with larger applications than what
  I was  exposed to in school which has been challenging but doable.  Working with code that is
  not my own has also been a strange transition, as I have encountered a few different styles of
  thinking and organization within the code.  Following an established Software Development Life
  Cycle has also been a great experience.  Working for a larger organization like WPS, you need
  to work with different business units to achieve common goals.  The exposure to this team atmosphere
  is a change from the mostly isolated classroom assignments and has been a nice way to pave the way
  from student to professional.
