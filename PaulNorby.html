     <p>About the developer - Hello!  I'm Paul Norby, developer in training!  Hopefully you find my site interesting and unique.  A little about myself; Born in Madison, WI I have lived here my entire life except for a four month <span>study abroad semester </span>in Costa Rica.  I grew up as an outdoors kid playing lots of sports, camping with my family, and riding motorcycles.  Family has always been important to me and as of June, 2017 I became a father and became the head of my own family which has truly been a blessing.  In school, foreign language was always a strong suit and something I enjoy which is why I have found myself so attracted to computer language.  Currently I am fluent in Spanish, and am learning multiple computer programming languages.  My goal is to become a Senior Developer or Software Engineer with a respected company.  Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments using the contact information provided.  I look forward to speaking with potential employers and hope to hear from you soon!
